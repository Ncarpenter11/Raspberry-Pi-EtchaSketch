# Raspberry-Pi-EtchaSketch

The goal with this was to create software that could do basic
interactions with an etch-a-sketch. (Made for Electronic
instrumentation course)

The hitch values may need to be changed depending on the Etch-A-Sketch
motors used. the hitch anticipates a change in direction and starts turning
the motors that many units earlier, to create neat corners.
